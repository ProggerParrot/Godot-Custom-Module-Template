Here is a small template for creating custom Godot Modules. 
Inside the src-folder, you can find 2 ways of implementing an example c++ class.

On the one hand you have an example of an integrated custom reference of the calculator.
And on the other hand there is also an example for a custom Node.


UPDATE: Now there is Scons building and VS-Code support! 
But you can also just use the pure sourcecode, and throw the other stuff away ;D


Feel free to use this template for your own work!
Additionally i created two videos for you, how to use this stuff:
