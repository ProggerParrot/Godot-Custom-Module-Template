# Godot-Custom-Module-Template
Here is a small template for creating custom Godot Modules. Inside you can find 2 ways of implementing an example c++ class.

On the one hand you have an example of an integrated custom reference of the calculator.
And on the other hand there is also an example for a custom Node.

Feel free to use this template for your own work!
Additionally i created a video for you how to use this stuff:
